0,5.0,This is a good calculator through high school and beyond.,"As a chemist I use a programmable graphing calculator.  However I also tutor high school and college students and have used TI 30 series calculators for that purpose for decades.  This calculator is more than adequate for junior high school, high school and most college courses.  In addition it is a bargin.  Most standardized tests and teachers who allow calculators for tests allow the TI 30 series.  It handles calculations found in all high school courses.  It comes with a rudimentary instruction sheet and a quick reference card.  TI used to package a comprehensive paperback book with this series.  That manual is still available online in pdf format as a free download.The package includes the calculator.  It has an internal battery that can be replaced with some difficulty.  Routinely the calculator relies on a solar cell which operates the device and charges the battery.  Classroom light is sufficient to power the solar cell.  There is a hard case that slides on to protect the face of the calculator.  When not in use the cover can slide on the back for storage.  There is a slot in the case to hold the quick reference card.  There is also a basic information sheet in the package.For those who worry about such things this is built in the Philippines.  The TI 30 series has been one of the most popular entry level scientific calculators since the 1970s.","October 7, 2019",the United States
1,5.0,"Finally, a color that matches my coffee-loving soul","Do you ever have problems with people recognizing that you're female?  Do people ever have the gall say that you're a ""reasonable"" and ""practical""  person?  Finally, are you tired of people mooching off you by asking to use your calculator?  If this has happened to you or someone you love, buy this calculator in this obnoxious pink color immediately!No one will be able to mistake you for anything but the pink-loving, somewhat basic girl that you are, and best of all, many, due to their masculinity complexes, will not want to use your calculator merely because of the bright color!But in all seriousness, I bought this because someone stole my factory-color blue version.  I bought this to be a little more distinctive so that maybe it won't happen again.As for the product, package came fast, all buttons work sharply -- good feedback when pressed.  I personally love this calculator -- I can't stand a casio.  TI all the way.  I can actually see what I'm taking the logarithm of instead of getting an error once I hit the log button.  I would buy this a thousand times over (if I weren't already broke of course)Enjoy!","September 25, 2017",the United States
2,3.0,NOT recommended for test taking!,This is a fine calculator. It works great. Has more functions than I'll probably ever use. Then why do I not recommend it?There is a design flaw.I have attached 3 photos where you see the screen. You'll notice that when you turn the calculator on and look at it from an angle (as you would if you kept it on a desk while you were testing) the numbers are not legible. Your line of sight has to be almost perpendicular or direct to see it clearly. This does not affect the function of the calculator but it gets inconvenient when you have to hover over the calculator or lift it up to read it. In a test taking setting this constant movement was suspicious enough to warrant a warning from the proctor.,"September 14, 2017",the United States
3,5.0,"All-round Workhorse for Algebra, Trigonometry and Chemistry","Excellent calculator, I use it for university level algebra, trig and chemistry and it has so far held up to the constant workout and being carried around in my book bag and occasionally dropped. This is the version of calculator that my university's Math Department allows for test taking. ""higher"" level calculators that graph are not allowed.","July 13, 2018",the United States
4,5.0,Great Value,"I recently purchased this calculator to have at home. I’ve been teaching middle school math for a couple decades and this is the calculator we’ve used. It is reliable, can withstand repeated falls on tile floors, and daily use by ms aged students. It has more capability than most of us will ever use, but may lack some features needed for higher level college/specialized math. The two line helps to verify inputs.  The slide off case is handy far transport and storage. It has a few quirks. The display is large enough but unreadable as the viewing angle increases. It provides “syntax error” when using a negative number in the denominator with the Ab/c function and a few other situations. I went through school before calculators so these aren’t problematic for me, but might be for today’s students.  The reliability, durability, longevity, and capability at this price makes this a great value. I like it.","October 24, 2020",the United States
5,5.0,"Good scientific calculator for high school, SAT, ACT","This calculator is a good one for use in a high school science class.  I recommend it for my chemistry and physics students because it covers all of the functions we use, and it is inexpensive.  I had to get used to the syntax for operations, because it seems backwards from my older calculators.  You must type in equations as they read on paper.  For example, if you want to do the equation 1.7 X sin55, you would literally type everything in in exactly that order.  On some of my other scientific calculators I would have to type in the 55 and then hit the sine button.  I'm not sure if one way or the other is better, but with a little practice this is a very good calculator.","November 13, 2019",the United States
6,5.0,Great calculator with all you need.,"from high school.  I've only had it for a few weeks, but I'm already impressed with how easy it is to work with.  I'm particularly impressed with it's statistical capabilities--I would have thought you would need a more of a heavy duty graphing calculator to do some of the things I've been able to do with this little guy.","May 5, 2016",the United States
7,5.0,Great for middle school!,"An absolute classic of a calculator. I used maybe this exact same model over a decade ago in school, and just purchased this one for my niece in 6th grade. It has a nice big display that makes it easy to see and every function that she will need for the next few years. It is also approved for any state testing. I don't know if the graphic calculators are allowed yet, but they weren't when I was in school.","September 22, 2016",the United States
8,5.0,Ok,"I learned to use Casio, so when my professor told me I have to use this one I was in pain. It’s ugly to look at and type numbers. It hurts… or maybe that is my hatred for anything algebra.I mean to write, it is just a calculator. It works is all I can say. Still Casio is better, easier, and not an ugly barf blue. Looks like what barfed blueberry’s would look like. If that is a concern then choose a different color. Casio in my opinion is easier to learn. But that is bc that is the one I learned first. But I do know for a fact Casio is better organized.","April 9, 2022",the United States
9,5.0,Cheap and gets the job done,"I used this calculator for the third and final exams of a trigonometry class, and it worked very well.  The math coordinator only allows devices that will allow checking answers (but don't give an exact answer).  I really don't have any dislikes, but I do like its sturdiness - this thing will take a beating.  I'm not very good at math and I start getting easily frustrated after I've been working on it for too long.  One of those occasions found me trying to destroy the calculator by  slamming it on a hard floor and then stomping it.  To my surprise it kept working...no cracked/garbled display, and all of the keys remained functional.  This is a simple, low-cost calculator that does what it's supposed to do and can take a good beating.","December 3, 2019",the United States
10,5.0,I needed a new scientific calculator,"I needed a new scientific calculator and this unit fit the demands I require of a calculator. My smartphone had these functions but I needed a calculator I could keep on my desk in the light and could be used without interruptions, such as an incoming call. The price for this calculator was very low and that made the purchase of this calculator my best choice.","July 17, 2022",the United States
11,5.0,Great little calculator,"I needed a basic calculator for my grad school work to crunch some survey and research numbers/data. This little thing fit the ticket and is very versatile. I remember using one throughout grade school and high school and it hasn't changed a bit since then. Same, tried and trued design. If you don't need graphing capabilities (and I don't) then this is a great tool.","May 31, 2022",the United States
12,5.0,Faithful and reliable,I have had this exact calculator for over 20 years.  I'm a pharmacist and use my calculator daily.  I finally had to replace it after 20 years and bought the exact same one!,"July 29, 2022",the United States
13,5.0,"Good, approved scientific calculator","This is the calculator that our Chemistry teacher approved for our Graduate Chem Course.I have used all kinds of calculators from the simplest one to TI84s.This is the best calculator for students who like to write out entire equations(instead of a multi-step process, i.e. (1x3x5)^4 rather than 1X3, then 2x5.....) It provides a 2-line view meaning after you punch in the equation, you are able to see the answer as well as what you input. You also have the option to edit your original input. And if you're like me and are always making careless errors this calculator is for you.I consider myself pretty technological. It was pretty hard to go from all the functionalities of a graphing calculator.I have taken all my graduate school tests using this calculator. Some of the students (mostly guys) found a Casio calculator to be a good option.But as someone who needs to be able to double check, edit, and double check answers again. This was the best option for me.Also, it's solar powered so no dead batteries here.","November 19, 2015",the United States
14,5.0,The White One is Awesome,"I really, really don't like the fact that I was required to buy this calculator for a Calculus class that I never wanted to take, but this totally does what it's supposed to do.I got the white one, which was totally a good idea for an extra $2 or whatever it was. I've seen it laying around several times and thought ""I wonder if I lost my calculator...?"" and then I check my bookbag and it's totally mine. If you would prefer to not lose the one thing keeping you from having a breakdown in your math class, opt for one of the less common colors.People complement my white calculator all the time, and honestly out of my class of 200 college kids, I've never seen another one.","March 11, 2017",the United States
15,5.0,Calculator recommended for middle school,"Durable case keeps it protected. The blue color is very nice. It works well, and it is the scientific calculator recommended for our middle school student. The brand is well known and makes great calculators. The instructions are to the point and thorough. Great calculator at a great price!!","July 5, 2022",the United States
16,5.0,recommended by Algebra II teacher,"My son is in 10th grade taking Algebra II and this specific model and brand was recommended by his teacher so all my son had to do is a pick the color and it was delivered in fast 2 days, thanks to Amazon Prime.I do like that it works on battery as well as solar power so as long as there's enough indoor lights, which will save battery life.  It's very sturdy and it comes with a protective case that can be snapped back of the calculator when in use.THE BOTTOM LINE:5 out of 5 stars.  Highly recommended.  Hope this helps and let me know if you have any questions.","September 25, 2019",the United States
17,5.0,"I've actually owned several of these!  If you can't use a graphing calculator, then this is the model to use.","This model from Texas Instruments was the gold standard for me throughout algebra and then again in graduate school.  For calculus and pre-calculus, I switched to the TI-89 graphing model.  After a certain point in school, the graphing calculator becomes unnecessary for daily needs (and not allowed).At that point, I purchased another one of these TI-30's.  This calculator has all of the basic functions along with the logarithmic functions (ln and log).Advantages:-Calculator is portable, reliable.-Many standardized tests will not allow graphing calculators.  In that case, this is the calculator to use.-The buttons are well spaced (much better than those small, solar powered, small blue calculators).-No additional batteries required (solar powered).Disadvantages:-If you are in high level calculus, you will likely need and want graphing functions.  Otherwise, this is a much more reliable and portable calculator.-If you are in high level financial courses, you will likely need a financial calculator.  The financial calculator lacks the logarithmic functions but includes the rate and time (present and future) values of money.","June 24, 2013",the United States
18,5.0,Calculates,"I got this to use for my college algebra class and it has been excellent. I went with pink because it was the cheapest color. No regrets.Update: I have used this calculator for over a year now and it has never disappointed me. It got me through a college algebra class perfectly fine. Currently, it is still going strong through calculus and trigonometry (via a precalculus class). It doesn't graph - but for what I paid it has done everything else. I'm so happy with it that I bought one for my fiancee so we don't have to fight over this one while doing math together. So far, I haven't really found a function it wasn't able to do and with a statistics class in the lineup, it looks like this will be another very useful tool. I never thought I would be reviewing a calculator.","November 2, 2018",the United States
19,5.0,Will get you through any class that doesn't require graphing,"It's easy to use and learn, but I got this as a backup for my classes that don't require a graphing calculator and coming from a backlit screen to this means it can be kind of hard to read sometimes since it doesn't have a backlight. That being said I used a calculator just like this all throughout high school with no problem. And for the price I'd have gone with this one over a graphing calculator every time if my calc classes didn't require a graphing calculator. I also love the color!","November 22, 2020",the United States

He is “ o my” just shy of being 12 years old , however is working at about two full grades ahead of his classmates in math and reading skills, so, we are all very pleased with this purchase and he’s BEYOND thrilled with this product ... and already has a couple more fancy versions on his birthday wishlists 😁I’m positive he is going to be one of Texas Instruments’ life long loyal customers !! 💜","February 9, 2020",the United States
21,5.0,The best for my math students!,"I love this calculator. I have taught 7th grade math for years, and this is the calculator I choose for my kids. We can do so much with this calculator.

22,5.0,These calculators are handy. I'm a math major and ...,"These calculators are handy. I'm a math major and purchased this for a work related class, as they wanted to instruct on a scientific calculator, but not a fancy or costly one. I've been impressed and carry it around with me still. I have a TI-83plus and a TI-NSpire CAS, but this one still fits a niche. This particular blue calculator was a second purchase for my daughter for high school geometry class. She loves it.","October 11, 2017",the United States
23,5.0,My Favorite Calculator,"This is my favorite calculator. I am on my second one of them (one of them lasted through engineering school and finally had to put to rest when the screen broke after 5-6 years heavy use with things like 8 hour exams). I also requested that I get 2 for work, one for my desk in the office and one for my bench in the laboratory. For the price, this is an excellent calculator, and if you put in the time to learn the functions it can do quite a bit (calculates averages, standard deviations, and more).Also, I did try to switch to an app on my phone at one point, but none of them compare in functionality with a real scientific calculator, and usually phones are prohibited during exams.One other thing - this calculator is on the approved list for the Oregon Fundamentals of Engineering Exam as well. I wouldn't trust any other calculator (graphing calculators not allowed) to get me through that, and it did just fine.","July 21, 2014",the United States
24,5.0,"Great Price, Great Value","Like others have posted this is not as pictured.  The design is not the floral or the geometric as the two pictured.  The design part in these pictures is all white on the calculator I received.  If this is a big deal to you, you may want to go to a store where you can pick the design you want.  For me the pink color met my requirements.A great basic non graphing scientific calculator at a great price.  My school bookstore charges $20 for these and only has them in black.  Pink makes it stand out so you know it is yours and makes doing math more fun!It is solar powered with a battery back up.  It has a cover that snaps on the back when you dont need it shut, and there is a cheat sheet for the functions that is in the cover.  I love Texas Instruments, they make products meant to last.  This is a nice quality plastic making it very durable and last a life time.Cannot beat the price, and Prime 2 day free shipping.  Always looking to save a buck.","January 10, 2013",the United States
25,5.0,Real good math thingey,"This calculator can add stuff...like numbers. It can also subtract stuff...also numbers. I ain't used me the other symbols like the ""X"" and the line with the dots over and under it cuz they scare me. But I might've got me a cousin once who knowed how to use all them fancy symbols...he went to fifth grade...grandpappy seys he was the smartest one of the litter. I used to like to thump him. But now I got me a real fancy calculator so I bet he ain't laughing no more!","June 29, 2021",the United States
26,5.0,Good calculator,"Came on time and no damage present. I have prime so this came quickly.I need this for college, since some classes don't allow the use of a graphing calculator. I like this better than the TI-30a because it has the 2 line view.My school also sells it at their bookstore but it's $5-6 more than the price on Amazon, which is why I went with Amazon.I like using Texas Instruments calculators, because they're pretty good. I have a TI-84 plus and I've been using that since middle school.","February 1, 2017",the United States
27,5.0,Just Right for Teaching Chemistry Classes ...,"When working properly, these are wonderful calculators: affordable, simple to learn, fuctional, small, comes with case, easy to reset the memory, etc.It's not as bulky or expensive as something like the TI-89 and on series of graphing calculators.I recommend these calculators for all my chemistry classes. I've never had to use the sin, cos, and tan buttons, but one feature that is especially useful in science class is the ability to shift between scientific notation and normal notation (end, sci/eng, right, enter). It sounds more complicated than it really is and once you do it once, you'll be fine.Occasionally, there are individual calculators that will have poorly made buttons that stick a little. In that case, you have to be extra careful when inputting data, but usually this gets fixed with enough use.Conclusion: Good choice for science class.","June 1, 2014",the United States
28,5.0,School Supply Necessity,This type of calculator was on my son's 6th grade school Supply list. I was happy to see that Amazon had it for a very good price in a variety of colors. My kiddos is not so mad about math because of his Sonic blue calculator.,"August 10, 2022",the United States
29,5.0,Engineers can have pink too,"As an engineering student, I have to take a lot of math course. My calculus course allowed us to use a calculator - but of course not the fancy graphing one.I had gone all around my college town searching for this calculator. Seems like everyone needed it.Figured I’d give amazon a go and it was much cheaper - and in pink! No more getting confused whose is whose!So far, I love how it shows what I’ve typed in as a 2 line calculator. Some don’t show what you’ve previously typed in and you have to hope you pressed the right button!It’s also so easy to figure out.","December 3, 2018",the United States
30,5.0,Excellent,I purchased this for a physics class I was taking and it works great and did everything I needed it to do. Lot's of great videos on teh internet to learn how to use it. Terrific price for a name brand. I'm happy with my purchase and would purchase it again.,"May 16, 2022",the United States
31,5.0,Great calculator,"I like my gadgets to be colored differently from the normal grey and black and I needed a scientific calculator to grade statistics papers, so I bought this one for cheap.  I don't know what I can say - it's a great scientific calculator.  Has all of the functions that are necessary for me - sine, cosine, tangent; fraction to decimal; probability functions; several statistical functions (to the point that we don't actually allow this calculator on our statistics exams; it solves the mean, standard deviation and variance for a list of variables) and others.  There's a little card inside the cover that tells you how to perform these functions.  And it's pink!  I'm the only one with a pink calculator so I know it won't disappear.Only note - it's not exactly as pictured.  The window around the screen doesn't have any pink flowers on it; it's just white.  Other than that, it looks like the picture.","August 25, 2013",the United States
32,5.0,Great Quality,"I bought two of these for my 2 homeschooled middle schoolers to have as they venture into algebra and they’ve been great. I used Texas Instrument back in my Calculus days and when it came time to get my kids a good, durable calculator to last, there just wasn’t any question about it. This calculator is easy to use, displays your equation on the screen, and is good quality. This will last them through Algebra, Chem, and up until pre-Calc, when we will have to upgrade to graphing calculators. Very happy with these good looking, durable calculators.","February 26, 2020",the United States
33,5.0,Great calculator for students!,"I used this calculator for college-level chemistry and statistics. It was exactly what I needed, since more advanced versions  (TI-89s) weren't allowed by my professors. Even now that I've graduated, I still have this calculator on hand for every day tasks since it's more user friendly and practical than other models. Still works like a charm!","September 15, 2021",the United States
34,5.0,The next best thing to a TI-8X series graphing calculator,"The next best thing to a TI-8X series graphing calculator, for when you don't need or can't use a graphing calculator. No longer will I be forced to chose between hauling out the TI-89 or using free promotional item calculators that don't even do order of operations correctly. The fact that the TI-30X has more complicated functions than a standard desktop calculator is a great feature that discourage moderately stupid people from 'borrowing' it.","July 12, 2017",the United States
35,5.0,Best calculator for the money,"Needed a calculator for some science classes that do not require advance math functions...Chemistry, Biology, etc.  I was afraid that I would have to drop some serious $$$ on a scientific calculator but this one is pretty inexpensive and does everything I could have asked for.  Really though, except for the basic functions every calculator performs, I have only used the parenthesis and exponent functions often but I can say that they work well.  Also, the ""SCI"" mode helped me a lot with scientific notation problems.  Plus it is a TI, so I know it will last.  Unless you are about to embark on a deep mathematical journey or really need graphing functions, this calculator will rock your socks (as much as a calculator can).","March 23, 2015",the United States
36,5.0,Cool little calculator,"Cool little calculator, one downfall though, you have to look straight down on it to read the display clearly, you can't look at it from an angle, you won't be able to see the numbers correctly, I guess it's the way the LED display is designed, other than that, good little calculator!","July 20, 2021",the United States

The contents inside also took the abuse but this calculator stood the test of time and made it to high school.  It was replaced this in high school not because it died, didn't work right or for any other reason that we needed a different one.  This one will still last for years to come.Over the years, it has become scratched and the numbers wore slightly.  We lost the cheat sheet it once had.  We still have the cover and it still slides nicely.","March 20, 2016",the United States

Some calculators are better at specific things, but in my experience this is the best all-around calculator in the “scientific calculator” category.I also love that it comes in pink. As a straight white man in a majority-male electrical-trade school, it serves as a constant reminder for me to challenge my ingrained ideas of masculinity. Plus I’ll never lose it; the pink is bright and serves as a theft deterrent in my trade school.","February 18, 2020",the United States

I've gone to and from school, and in between classes with it in my extremely full backpack. Even after a year of usage, my calculator shows no damage internally and externally.Most colleges and middle/high schools will recommend students to buy this calculator for school. Definitely worth the purchase, and comes in fun colors too.","August 11, 2017",the United States

47,5.0,Best Calculator I've Ever Used!,"I've always used this particular model in high school, so I was excited when I saw there were different colors you can get it in. By the way, my last one died of unknown reasons...Either way, this calculator has been good so far. One of my favorite things about this product is that the memory functions are so easy to store and that you can solve multiple operations in one go! It's also compact and not to mention very cute.The only thing I dislike about it is that it's inconvenient at times. For instance, let's say I want to find 1 over 5pi or anything with a denominator that's a function of its own. If you type 1/5pi, the calculator reads it as 1/5 times pi. I know some of you probably will say: ""duh, that's obvious"". But it's annoying during tests when I'm pressed for time to have to miss a question because I forgot to add a bracket in my calculation.However, this calculator is still awesome and I'm totally independent on it. I got an F on my quiz because I forgot to bring this to school one day and had to borrow the teacher's old CASIO. I seriously do not know how to operate that thing. This is so much easier - and fool-proof, I should say, than most other scientific calculators.I hope this review was helpful to you, and that you learn from my mistakes and use mental math and dimensional analysis once in a while to prevent the occurrence of any errors in your work.","December 29, 2012",the United States

49,5.0,"Well built, nice cover","My daughter needed a scientific calculator for school.  This one meets all her requirements and was a good bargain.  Since all algebraic calculators are basically the same, the thing that I really like about this one (other than the price) is the cover.The cover is a strong hard plastic that slides over the front, covering it completely.  When the calculator is in use, the covers slides onto the back.  That's a really handy way to keep the cover while it is in use while also providing great protection for the front of it when it is banging around in a backpack.Also on the cover is a really handy sticker with instructions for the lesser used -- and therefore harder to remember -- functions.","January 8, 2013",the United States
50,5.0,Works Great,"We already had one of these in green for my son.  His younger sister kept borrowing it because she liked it so much better than the one we had for her.

51,5.0,Can't beat a TI!,"I always used a TI when I was in school and college. I can't remember where I lost my TI 89 graphic one, which even had a link to copy programs from other TI graphics. This is the next best thing to a graphic one. It is a good gift for kids, so long as they don't use it for geometry or other subjects that require graphing or complex calculations.","June 17, 2020",the United States
52,5.0,Great price!,Cheapest price I’ve seen for this calculator! I was unsure if it came with a cover and it does! This will be perfect for my 6th grader.,"July 25, 2022",the United States
53,5.0,Works great. Love 2-line display.,"Function:It works great for basic and not so basic calculations and the 2-line display definitely helps when you are like me and need to double and triple check that you input the right equation (with my old one-liner I did the calculation twice just to make sure), so in that sense, it's a time saver.I particularly like the memory function. I can store values to constants I use frequently in certain calculations. Very easy and straight-forward.Looks:I carry large bags that hold half of my life at any given point. So when I need something it can take a while to find it. This calculator stands out from the other stuff because it has a very pretty, super girly bright pink color. Also, if you are in a big group of people (say, study group) and everyone has the same type of calculator, there will be no room for confusion--you'll be the only person with the hot pink one.Overall, a good product and it looks more fun than most. Yes, I am a nerd and find calculators fun!","November 10, 2011",the United States
54,5.0,Great price for a great product!,"It does what it's supposed to do. Before I started my fall semester at my local college, I needed a scientific calculator for my stats class. I went to my local Rite Aid and they were selling them for $99 a piece. When I looked on Amazon, they were $10.96 (at the time of purchase). Why would I pass up such a savings? I'm a college student, on a limited budget, I can't just throw away money when I need that money for basic essentials (like food, transportation costs, books, etc.).The calculator does everything I need it to and more. If you're looking for a great calculator at a great price, I highly suggest this product.","October 15, 2014",the United States

57,5.0,Did what it was supposed to,Not much to say about this calculator it works smoothly and efficiently. Had it for over 3 years now and it still works like new and I never had any issues with it. Easy to learn and use I would recommend to anyone looking for a small and efficient calculator.,"July 30, 2021",the United States
58,5.0,Simply elegant and incredibly cute!!,"As an accounting major in college, I use calculator A LOT. When I was on a hunt for a pink one this design immediately captured my eyes, however, the floral design on the top appeared to be a little bit tacky in my opinion. After reading previous reviews though I realized that the product is not exactly the same as shown here in the pic, instead of flowers the top part is just plain white. when I got it in the mail today, i was so excited for it and started using it right away. For this price nothing else can beat this one if you're looking for a calculator that stands out.I also uploaded a customer picture, go check it out :P","February 4, 2013",the United States
59,5.0,Math Class Must,"Slim design, but buttons and screen are easy to read.  Huge upgrade from the older bulky calculators.  The calculator performs all the functions needed for my college Math class.  Solid design for a great price!","June 23, 2022",the United States
60,4.0,"Takes some getting used to, but it's a good calculator and solar power is a plus","I bought this calculator for a chemistry course that didn't allow graphing calculators. I was hesitant to switch from my TI-89, which I love, and I will say this calculator took some getting used to. The buttons do not seem to be as sensitive as those on the TI-89, and I found that for the first several months I was constantly making ""typos"" that were actually just the calculator failing to register buttons that I had pressed. The buttons are 100% accurate as long as you type carefully, hitting the keys individually and pressing directly down on them rather than at an angle. So the calculator still works fine. I'm just used to the ease of typing of the other calculators I have used frequently, a TI-84 and a TI-89, which are much more forgiving and can be typed on much faster and more accurately. And obviously, even one missed key can create a big problem when doing a math problem. However, that's the only reason I'm deducting a start from this review.I'm quite pleased with everything else about this calculator. It has more functions than I expected for such a small device, and I LOVE the fact that it is solar powered (a feature that I wasn't aware of until I had owned the calculator for several weeks, as they don't advertise this fact nearly as much as they could). It is slim, light, and sturdy, and I've been using it for months with no technical problems. Overall, once I got used to it, I'm satisfied with it.","October 22, 2017",the United States
61,5.0,My 14 year old prefers this one,My 14 year old was entering high school this year and had this calculator in middle school that was a little beat up.  He wanted a new one.  They usually sell them at all the major stores but were out during back to school so picked it up on Amazon.  Works well.,"October 29, 2020",the United States
62,5.0,Great for ACT,"Ordered this calculator after reading up on which calculators were best for the ACT. It was so helpful on the math portion! Saves time to be able to quickly find the square root with the push of a single button or be able to multiply a number by a specific power. Love it! Comes with a case that snaps onto the back when the calculator is in use, and slides onto the front when not. Great price! And the pink color is bright and super cute. :)","December 30, 2016",the United States
63,5.0,Make Algebra painful again!,"You're probably aware of the App that allows students to take a picture of an equation, submit it to the App, and then are rewarded with the solved equation SHOWING THE WORK!  It's time to put the pain and anguish back in Algebra and have students actually learn something!  This calculator  should be considered mental exercise equipment. Lock up their phones, hand them this calculator- enjoy!","January 28, 2017",the United States
64,5.0,Great little calculator,"I needed to purchase this calculator for a statistics class that I took online. The calculator worked great, but does not have the graphing/dot plot capabilities. I used a separate application called StatCruch for that. As for this calculator, I recommend using Youtube to learn how to use some of the features. It did the job! Thanks.","April 8, 2020",the United States
65,5.0,Did Not Calculate.,Sorry I didn't get a pic but my ass of a 14 year old had took off from the house before I could even find out if it was awesome or not. But since it's a Texas Instruments I know it's awesome. It was pretty affordable too!,"February 20, 2021",the United States

No problem I told her, I have a Ti-55 that I used in college that you can have.  After 30 years of sitting in dark drawers I put some new batteries in the old Ti-55 and fired her off.... Well sort of.... it did come on, but kinda refused to perform even the most basic of functions... Time for a new calculator.  This new calculator comes in pink, and cost less than $20.  I forget how many hundred that the old Ti-55 cost, but with inflation it would probably make a nice dent in the next semester of college payments...","November 13, 2014",the United States
67,5.0,Nice Calculator,"I bought this to replace a scientific calculator that was over 20 years old and had finally given up the ghost. One of the things I like about this calculator is that it shows the values and operations used in a calculation, which helps prevent errors in entry. Another great feature is that it has a solar panel to keep the included battery at full charge. Overall, it is a great value at little cost.","September 28, 2018",the United States
68,5.0,Awesome!,"Using this in my statistics class, I got to use it before in trigonometry which was offered at the high school I graduated from. Packaged with some sort of bubble wrap, air filled pickets to cover the calculator that already comes in its own thin cardboard and plastic, A big box carrying everything... This came early with Prime so that worked out very well with my timing. Very useful for college level math and easier to use than the big TI calculators.","January 27, 2022",the United States
69,5.0,There isn’t much it can’t do,"I use it for routine stuff and statistical computing after mastering the way it works. The predicessor to this one endured a dose of Drambouie and subsequent tap water rinse. After three days of Arizona sun and dry air, it worked as if nothing had happened.

76,5.0,Love these calculators,"Bought a bunch of these calculators to put in drawers in my office, kitchen, desk, etc.I first got hooked on the TI-30xII in college when my TI-86 graphing calculator died.  I didn't need another $100+ grapher but loved their ability to call up old functions and see my entire equation written out (and editable) before computing it.  The TI-30xII fits that bill entirely without being expensive or overburdened with excessive features.Only negative is that you can't change the screen contrast, but other than that I don't forsee ever buying a different kind of calculator.","July 23, 2010",the United States
77,5.0,It's a good one!,"This is a great little calculator. Has survived drops, being squashed between books, and ""just works"". The command history/line editing is a great bonus, and is one of the things that really sets it apart from other calculators of its size/functionality. The button action is also very good---they feel responsive, not squishy like on similar new HP models. The multi-line display has become a ""must"" for me, now that I've gotten used to it---single-line calculators just aren't good enough anymore. I've purchased more than one of these units, and would certainly buy more if the ones I have died. But they haven't.","July 21, 2012",the United States

It doesn't really have any features out of the ordinary.  The solar panel portion works and the calculator does not shut off on you.  Buttons are responsive and do not stick.

90,5.0,"Cheap calculator that does almost everything a TI-84 does, but without graphing","Basically a high-end calculator without the high-end price.It's required to fend-off cheating at my school. I enjoy it because you can enter equations into it instead of hoping you're rhetoric is correct (if you're using a single-line calculator).If you need a calculator that does everything but games and graphing, this is your pick, just be patient, it cant handle typing too fast.Practice makes perfect for this calculator, and if you're moving down from a TI-83 or TI-84 or TI-86, you'll feel right at home.","March 2, 2014",the United States

First of all, you can buy a cheap netbook for that price.  Second, the supposedly the main reason for super expensive calculators is for SAT / ACT exams.

99,5.0,Nice!,"Teaching chemistry and having a student friendly calculator is a must. The TI-30XIIS is my favorite scientific student calculator. The calculator can run on both solar and battery power so when the lights go out and it is too dim for solar to work the students can still use the calculators. The 2-line function makes it a breeze to go back and fix a mistake when a long entry is being made without starting at the beginning. I also like how the calculator has [^] for the exponent function. The teacher kit comes with 10 calculators, a holder for the 10 calculators (if you have more than one they stack very nicely), a teachers manual, and a nice large poster of the calculator.","July 5, 2012",the United States

It is light, portable, and very durable. In 6 years I've had the same calculator that has suffered falls, spills, and it still works like new. The large display is very nice and easy to read.

277,5.0,TI30XIIs vs. CASIO300,"Comparing the Texas Instruments TI30XIIs calculator to the CASIO, the CASIO might be more user friendly and easier to use fractions.

For example (4)(4) divided (4)(4). Sorry I don't know how to put a divided symbol into this text.  The correct answer is 16; the CASIO will give an answer of 1.  It is easily corrected by remembering to put a times symbol between the parentheses, but it is still annoying that CASIO refuses to correct this logic error.Both are excellent calculators.

The buttons are starting to act up a bit and my daughter needed one for college, so I ordered her this one.

I.e., 1/x symbol is now X-1? and the square root has been moved back to 2nd function when it used to be a primary function.  Its a pain since you used the square root function all the time.  A bit nit picky, but they messed up a really good designed calculator.  I do like the fact that it now inputs formulas that you can see on the screen.  But why mess with the keyboard and make it less user friendly.","March 4, 2020",the United States

Super easy to understand if you already know how to use the more advanced Texus Instruments calculators. The solar panel is a nice touch to avoid changing/charging batteries.Unfortunately, this calculator can completely ruin a complex math equation and has actually been the cause of some of my calculations on an exam being wrong. The logic is not the problem. The buttons sometimes just don't work. The calculator has an actuation-feel, but you MUST bottom-out the button press even when you feel the button ""click"" (more like a button ""mush""). If you aren't paying attention and are pressing numbers quickly, the calculator will not record some inputs. Other colleagues who own this calculator have the exact same issue. This is unacceptable.For some, the input-misses are a dealbreaker. Keep this in mind before you buy, but it's a required calculator in some college courses, so I recommend it over others.","June 28, 2018",the United States

However mine was a bit scratched up and I'd lost the cover so I ordered a new one.The new one I got off amazon has a problem with the screen: if you look at it at an angle you cannot see what the display reads.This is incredibly annoying and impractical. So much so that it ruins the calculator for me. I returned it and will be sticking with my old banged up one that doesn't have this issue.","April 13, 2020",the United States

The reason is that it does fractions quickly and easily and has two lines of display. The price was $3 higher than Wal-Mart, but I wanted a white one, thinking it would easier to find in my book bag. White's not as good as I thought it would be because it can get camouflaged by papers. It would be improved if it did 2-variable statistics.

You must be looking straight on at the screen. If you tilt the calculator even slightly it is unreadable. I noticed this when sitting at my computer desk.

This one does the job pretty well and has a nice list of features.  At less than $13, I'm pretty happy with my purchase.All of the expected trigonometry functions you would expect / want for a class are present and operate just as you'd expect.  It does a lot of other things, too.  Probability, log functions, variable storage for calculations (savable to an A, B, C, D or E slot) and about a dozen or so others.The included user manual is pretty typical in that it's a folded one-sheet piece of paper that has a front with function overviews and a back with examples you can work through that tell you what to punch in and what you should be seeing on your screen.  There is also a little ""cheat sheet"" that folds up inside the inside cover that basically has the same information.  You can also download a PDF version of the instructions online, which you might find more convenient to look at on your phone or computer.All in all, a pretty nice little calculator for the price.","February 10, 2022",the United States

First, I bought the  TI-36X Pro, and the chrome-colored main function buttons are difficult to read.  In addition, the TI-36X Pro has an unconventional function button above equals, which really causes problems because of muscle memory with all other calculators having the add button above equals.As for this version, the TI-30XIIS, it has none of those drawbacks.  Buttons are clearly visible.  Main function buttons have a conventional placement.

2784,4.0,Good calculator for most math classes.,"I purchased this TI for my Business Calculus class.  We are required to have a scientific calculator that does not have graphic ability. What I have found about this calculator is that while it works well, there are some additional steps that have to be taken when doing complex calculations. Where on some calculators you don't have bracket issues, this one, you have to really think out the steps otherwise the answer will come out incorrect.  It does however serve its purpose.  Once I figured out the bracket issues, it's worked like a champ.  I would recommend this calculator for those who need one for a math class, but I would invest in another version of the TI scientific calculator for more complex math class.","March 31, 2018",the United States

2787,4.0,Takes some getting used to....,I just needed a simple calculator as the one I have had for five-plus years decided it was going to stop working.  Getting a new one was just as cheap as replacing the batteries.  This one is a bit different from my last calculator so I have cussed at it a few times.  I'm glad it's not a human!!,"July 7, 2022",the United States
2788,4.0,A good calculator,"I bought this scientific calculator to help with Algebra, and it doesn't disappoint.Pros:  I enjoy the 2-line display. You can see the expression you entered (2+2) and the answer (5)* on two separate lines. Having a 2 line display helps in those instances where you come up with some weird answer, and upon review, you can easily see which variables you entered and realize that you fat-fingered in the wrong numbers. Remember, it is always your fault if the calculator gets the answer wrong. The included plastic cover is sturdy, it's fairly useful for covering up the keys so that you don't accidentally press the on button when the calculator is sleeping in your backpack. This means no more wasting your battery. The calculator has dedicated buttons for Pi, Square root, Cubing (and any other Exponent) and many other functions I'm not smart enough to use (yet). The buttons are large enough that I almost never press the wrong one. Not sure how long it should last, but I've been using it almost every day for a month, and the battery is great so far.Cons: I realize this is the basic layout for many different scientific calculators, but it's kind of annoying that the percent key is a secondary function, meaning you have to press the ""2nd"" button, and then the left parentheses key to enter a percent. I tend to use percents more than parentheses, so this annoys me. If you are a parentheses person, this shouldn't bother you.  The only other thing that bugs me is there's no dedicated ""Off"" button, ""Off"" is another secondary function. Pressing two buttons to turn off the calculator is annoying, but I suppose it's set up that way so you don't turn it off accidentally. Other than these small gripes, I have no complaints.Overall: Good calculator. I recommend it. Great deal for the price. If you can afford to spend a few extra bucks, it comes in several lovely colors. In hindsight, I wish I had bought the orange one (it was 18.99 when I bought this). There was also a lime green version that was selling for 30 dollars. Just think, if you buy this calculator, no matter what color you get...you'll be able to figure out exactly how much of a markup they charge for that green one.*2+2=4, I just wanted to see if anyone was paying attention to my math earlier.","May 2, 2014",the United States

2794,3.0,Beware Negative Number Calculations,"WATCH YOUR NEGATIVES. If you don’t make sure your negative numbers are enclosed in parenthesis, this calculator will give you the incorrect sign! I also have found that occasionally when I try to put in a decimal the calculator doesn’t accept it immediately and I have to do my calculations a second time to ensure the decimal makes it into the problem, which paired with the issue of negative numbers can be frustrating. Otherwise, this calculator looks nice and gets the job done as long as you pay close attention to what/how you’re plugging numbers in and don’t go too fast.","April 12, 2019",the United States
2795,3.0,Decent scientific calculator,"I had to get this since it was the only calculator that my college course accepted.The product arrived exactly as advertised and it serves its function well. With that, I cannot complain.The build quality is solid. The buttons are rather firm and clicky, so when you enter a number or something else, you can be sure that it's been inputted. The cover that this calculator comes with is nice and the calculator fits snugly inside; it's not loose at all. If I happen to drop it, I don't worry about it breaking at all. The addition of a solar panel means that I don't have to worry about battery life at all.The display leaves much to be desired. It's perfectly fine if you're looking directly at the screen. However, if you want to look at it from an angle, say it's laying flat on your desk a short distance from you, the numbers will hardly be visible, if at all. This is the kind of calculator that requires you to pick it up if you want to use it, so if you're the kind of person who lays their calculator flat on the desk a certain distance away while tapping away at its buttons, then this may not be a good buy for you.I was using a scientific calculator by another brand, and this calculator doesn't have the steepest learning curve. It does take some getting used to. I like how easy it is to switch from degree to radian mode and vice versa.However, I dislike how it cannot display answers in terms of pi. For example, when doing the inverse sine of 1 in radian mode, the display showed a decimal value instead of pi / 2. Yet, pi can be entered as a value. Same thing with Euler's number. Depending on your needs, this may or may not bother you.It doesn't have many functions. You cannot instantly find the roots to parabolic equations with it, you cannot instantly find the values of derivatives and integrals, and you cannot instantly find factorials or permutations or combinations. Again, based on your needs, it may or may not be a dealbreaker for you.Let me restate that I only bought this because it was the only accepted calculator for that specific course. Personally, I'd rather stick with my old scientific calculator if I were given the choice.","October 20, 2021",the United States
2796,4.0,It’s sparkly pale lilac pink  NOT white,"Well it’s a ti30 calculator but it’s not white.  In fact it’s sparkily pink or lilac.  The picture shows a white calculator and I’ve seen one in person and that’s what I wanted but what was shipped is not white.  For the price, I’ll keep it but it’s NoT what I wanted.  Disappointed.Update: I’ve seen at least two other people at school with one and it seems that they all have this somewhat pink tot them.  Iits how they were manufactured.  I’m starting to like the color a bit more.  They are outstanding calculators so that was a never a problem.  I do love that it’s solar powered and that I don’t ever need a battery.","September 23, 2018",the United States

2799,3.0,Annoying little bugger,"So, it functions as you would want it to except for 2 massive problems:1. The case back is ill-fitting and requires a real struggle to get on an off. I ended up putting a couple tiny drops of (shredder) oil on the sides, that seems to have made it a bit easier.2. I can't see the bloody screen half the time. When it's laying flat, the display just disappears. This is annoying because I have to pick it up and look directly at it when I'm using it. This means I can't just let it sit on the desk while I work. Frustrating little... just get a Sharp.","June 7, 2022",the United States
2800,2.0,Bad choice for fast typers.,"It's a fine calculator, until you get up to speed. It can't record key inputs fast enough for me, so numbers are missed and the results are wrong. I thought it was just my imprecise typing missing the center of the keys, but then I tested against another calculator. I just bought a TI-36X Pro and it doesn't have that issue. I looked online and other people have said the same thing. The 36X Pro also has a better display, so I can read it while it's sitting flat on my desk, and it shows more information at a time.","June 10, 2022",the United States
2801,4.0,"Great calculator, but not as good a display as the Casio models","This is our second TI non-graphing calculator (the graphing one we have is shown for size comparison, see the photo) and we got it again because it was the cheapest available. However, if I had been the one doing the second order and not my wife (who just hit ""reorder"" based on our purchase history), I would have ordered one of the Casio units that's just a few dollars more but has the nifty multi-line display. The Casio models show the equations with more natural styling and help you see everything much better, and some of the nicer ones come with algebra/calculus solving features even though they're still only twenty bucks or so. BOTTOM LINE: even though this TI calculator is just fine, if you spend a little more you can get a MUCH BETTER model.","January 31, 2019",the United States
2802,4.0,It's alright,"I also own the Ti-83, Ti-84, and a Casio fx-260solar (fancy title for a cheap scientific calculator). The Ti-30X IIS scientific calculator by comparison has an easy to understand layout of buttons, though it would have been great if the layout was more similar to the graphing calculators so that it's not such a big transition with button-hunting.It's a two-line calculator. The second line is handy in making sure you punched in the right numbers and operators, but is a little cumbersome for longer equations.My biggest con for the calculator is that the buttons are really plastic-y and require a bit of force to press down so that it makes the entry. This makes me constantly glance at the second line and waste a bit of time in my calculations. I guess the amount of force is a matter of perspective; I'm used to using the minimum force necessary to preserve the life of the calculator's buttons.The cover is a bit scarce, but functional.My primary gripe with the Ti line of calculators is how they handle exponents on negative numbers. Casio does it right by multiplying the entire negative number against itself for whatever the exponent is (for example, -2^2 equals 4). But for Ti's calculators, -2^2 equals -4. To get the Casio effect, you have to do (-2)^2 to equal 4. You may think this gripe is trivial, but when dealing with trigonometric formulas and such, it makes for errors in calculations when running long equations and you forget the burdensome parenthesis.Minus a star for the buttons, other than that it's reliable and functional.","February 7, 2012",the United States
2803,4.0,Surprising error handling for underflow,"Be careful with underflow. When values get too big, the calculator reports a helpful bounds error message. However, when dividing numbers too small, no such error message displays. Instead, the calculator silently consumes the corruption and displays zero. Which can throw off later calculations.","July 20, 2022",the United States
2804,5.0,Excellent calculator - Excellent price!!,"This was an excellent price and perfect calculator. My son’s teacher switched the type of calculator she wanted at the last minute, so I had to send this back and order a different one from Amazon.","October 19, 2018",the United States

I use these on this to keep it clean. Even with that it gets scratched all over. My only solution is to avoid wiping the screen if possible. It is the lone issue with this product but a big issue. If they would put a scratch resistant screen on and up the price a few dollars it would be the perfect scientific calculator.,"December 29, 2019",the United States

I'll be using it for chemistry and statistics in the fall and it's awesome that it's standardized testing approved.

I needed something that could do engineering notation- which this can. It does everything I need it to right now.My only complaint is that sometimes the buttons can be a little difficult to press quickly... i find myself having to push a button more than once when I am trying to enter in calculations quickly. The buttons aren't quite as reactive, or rather- don't have that satisfying click when you push the button to let you know it was fully pressed, such as you might get with a TI-84 or something like that, but this is also much cheaper, and also much less bulky. I think I may upgrade to something like a TI-84 in the future for more advanced classes, but at this point it serves it's purpose well. Also i love the solar power too- less concerned about the battery running out on me during a big exam.","February 9, 2014",the United States

If you put the information in, incorrectly, (most of the time the values have to be placed in parenthesis if you're doing something complicated), you will get a very off number.

I recently ordered this pink one for home use (also keeps me from mixing up my calculator with the kids'!) and am really disappointed by how cheap and brittle it feels.

I bought it for my 6th grade daughter taking Algebra at the time and she used it for a year and she liked it. The fact that it's pink helped.In 7th grade she is taking Geometry and has outgrown this calculator. It does fractions, but doing so not with grace because the bottom half of the display is not dot-matrix, but rather the 7-segment LCD like a digital watch. So while there is a F&lt;-&gt;D function, it struggles to display fraction. For example, entering ""5.5"" [2nd] [F&lt;-&gt;D] [=], the display shows 5u 1/2. Forget about other more complicated expressions like using Pi or radicals.A person in her class has a Casio FX115ES Plus, so I bought her one from Target. My wife complained that the pink calculator only lasted a year, but the functional difference is day-and-night. She can now do calculation using radicals (ã ) or pi (Î), and the answers are preserved with them. For example, if you type [ã]968[=], it returns 22ã2. You can even enter the whole expression (like 4/3xÎx10^3, but with proper fraction alignment and super-scripting for ^3). The answer for that, by the way, is (4000/3)Î. You can also use the [S&lt;-&gt;D] button to make it 4188.790205.Therefore, if you plan on taking Geometry in the future, I suggest you get the Casio for the same price instead of this unit.","May 14, 2013",the United States

2840,4.0,TI 30X IIS,"This calculator seems to be a good scientific calculator.  Unfortunately, it was not what I needed.  I had a TI 30X-A that was about 20 years old.  I loved it, but alas, it died.  When I went to replace, I could see the benefits of a two line calculator.  I liked the idea of dual power.However, since I mainly use it for accounting purposes, this calculator does not work for me.  I went through the manual looking for a way to make it work, but found none.  I use this for check books and other things where I need a running total.  IE. with this calculator, if you wish to enter 1+2+3+4 with a subtotal and then a total, you have to hit 1+2=+3=+4= to get an answers.  So I am saving this calculator for my preteen who will need ti soon enough and I went and bought another trusty TI-30XA.","August 31, 2009",the United States

The calculator is pink, the number pad is white, the arrow keys and + - X = and / signs are purple, everything else is pink, but the face is just plain white.

It states that it is pink however it is more on the purple side of the color spectrum.

I always feel like I'm going to drop it or mash a surprise button trying to hold it, but if I set it on the desk it rattles and jumps around with every button press.

It is very easy to use and has many of the same functionalities a graphing calculator may have, such as trigonometric functions and various essential constants; all in a much slimmer, smaller, and significantly less expensive package. The display is a bit compact if you plan on entering very long strings of an equation, however it is easily navigable to make up for this. The solar power works well under normal fluorescent lighting conditions, and the cover also slips on and off very easily.  Beyond the academic setting this calculator could be very convenient for home finances or any of the many tasks of life that require a little bit of calculation. I personally found it much quicker and easier to use than any phone calculator app I had. The only issue I ran into is, on occasion, a button would not fully compress and enter the number or sign requiring a second press from me (my TI-84 never had this issue).

The arrow keys allow you to cycle between previous commands, edit them, and works pretty well.I dislike how hard I need to press the buttons. If you don't press the buttons hard enough, it won't register. For a calculator, this can be disastrous; I often need to recheck my answers, especially on a test, to ensure every button I pressed was registered. I find that this one weakness costs me time, because I need to deliberately push the buttons slowly and firmly to make sure I don't need to enter everything a second time.Another issue is the case. The protective cover is a little difficult to take off. I suppose I can just not use it, but that isn't the point; it comes with a cover that is difficult to remove, frontways or backways.Those are my only gripes. Everything else about this calculator is great, so I only docked it a single star. I'm actually pretty close to giving this a 3 star rating, but it does everything else a calculator is supposed to do, so I'm being generous.

It's also really nice and light (especially compared to a TI-89).I just wish that the screen would show the previous answer while entering a new calculation. You can use commands to see the previous answer, but it's not convenient if you're doing a multistep calculation.","June 13, 2014",the United States
2945,4.0,Takes a minute to understand bit it does it's job.,"It takes a few minutes to find out how it works, the instructions aren't that great, but it does fine.  I've had no power issues despite my intermittent usage.  It's a little large for my hand but I haven't had any issues.  I dropped it once from roughly four feet and it still works.","June 23, 2018",the United States

2947,4.0,Calculator for college algebra,"Nice calculator, has all the functions I need for my college Algebra class. My biggest complaint is the buttons, they are plastic and flimsy and I sometimes think I hit the button but it doesn't register, obviously resulting in the wrong answer. I have to be careful to apply a lot of force when typing in my numbers. Other than that it is a good calculator for a nice price... they should have rubber buttons though.","March 4, 2014",the United States
2948,4.0,Does what it's supposed to do.,"I haven't really had to use the calculator yet, I need it for my math class but we haven't gotten that far yet.  I opened it up and messed around, it has all the functions that I need.  I am sad that I found the same calculator at Target for $3 cheaper and they had more festive colors.  I plan on reselling this back and then using that money to purchase a graphing calculator at some point.  For now, so far so good.","September 23, 2013",the United States
2949,4.0,It's OK if you have to use.,It's OK.  Only reason to use it is if calculators are restricted for your class.  The TI-36X Pro is HUGELY better than this calculator.,"August 11, 2020",the United States
2950,3.0,okay calculator,"Its hard to write a review on this when I typically use a 100.00 graphing calculator, but here I go. I needed this for a chemistry class in college and we were prohibited from using graphing calculators. I bought this one because I wasnt about to spend a lot of money on ANOTHER calculator. The buttons are not as well-made and the higher-line TI calculators. Sometimes I would push a button and the calculator wouldn't register I pressed anything. That messed me up during my calculations so I always had to push very deliberately to ensure I got accurate results. Its an overall 'okay' calculator. It gets the job done, is inexpensive (which is always nice), and lightweight/compact vs other models.","May 28, 2013",the United States

I like to keep my calculator on my desk while I press keys, but the screen is not visible unless you hold the calculator directly in front of your face. For this, you just put down anything else in our hand (book, pens) to use the calculator. Pretty disruptive to the thought process and workflow. Would not buy again.","November 21, 2019",the United States

2954,4.0,"Works, but keypad is not great",I bought this for a test where I couldn't use my normal graphing calculator. It has all the needed functions for most math/stats work. I like the window that shows your last operation. The keypad was not great. You really had to press each button. I found myself slowed down quite a bit during my test when I had to make sure my button presses were being registered. Overall it is okay but not great for everyday use.,"April 21, 2014",the United States

2959,4.0,Usually better than pen and paper,"I own a TI-Inspire CX CAS as well, that I would prefer to use. However there are plenty of grumpy old engineering professors who insist on using one of the approved calculators. This is one of those. It's cheap and some classes may even provide this type making it more likely to be familiar. You have to press buttons slowly and carefully to make sure everyone is registered and most equations won't fit in the screen causing all kinds of problems. That's not unique to this calculator though, all approved calculators are essentially the same. It's usually better than pen and paper, though not always.","August 6, 2014",the United States

2965,4.0,"Almost just what I needed, wish there was a cover with it",Needed this for a statistics class in university. The buttons aren't as sensitive as I'd like but I'm pretty sure that's a common issue of this model and it's not a huge deal because I need to check my numbers carefully anyway. I bought mine used so there was some scratch damage but nothing dramatic enough to hinder its use. I didn't realize it wouldn't come without a cover though.,"April 4, 2014",the United States
2966,4.0,This is a great product,"I was told to get a non-programmable calculator because the school doesn't want you to be able to encode equations in it that could help you cheat on a test. However I realized after buying it that it maintains a record of all calculations. Therefore, it actually is programmable. Despite this, there is a memory-wipe function so it can be made to conform with my prof's requirements.","March 7, 2014",the United States
2967,3.0,"Buttons require ""heavy"" touch","My calculus teacher did not allow graphing or calculators that could display more than two lines, so I ordered this one. I don't know if it's just the one I got or they're all like that, but the buttons on mine were a bit difficult to press. I had to press very deliberately in order for the numbers to input on the screen. If I was trying to type the numbers in very fast and I didn't press the numbers hard enough, it would skip numbers.  I've had calculators that only required light touch, so this was a negative for me.  I kept it just because returning was a hassle  and I needed it for my class :/","January 17, 2015",the United States
2968,4.0,Great little calculator!,"This calculator looks and works great. Honestly, the only problem I have with this at all is that the buttons are sticky and sometimes won't press when you hit them. I had this problem on my old TI-30X IIS calculator too, so I assume it's a manufacturing issue. However, this works great for classes that won't allow programmable calculators!","May 7, 2014",the United States

Turns out, college is terrible and they like to make you buy stuff. My science classes required a non-programmable scientific calculator, recommending this particular model. It was being sold for something like 18 dollars at the bookstore. Luckily, it's half that price online! It's a fine calculator, works as needed, but the buttons sometimes stick or don't press down and mess with my calculations. Drives me crazy. That's the only reason for the 4 star rating.

2981,4.0,Not what is shown in the picture!,"I ordered this calculator for an Algebra class at school. I thought it was a pretty pink color with a modern floral design (even though im not really a pink girl but i wanted a bright color for it to stand out from regular black or grey ones) I really liked the floral design but, alas, NO FLORAL DESIGN!!!  it is plain pink with a white square around the screen instead. Very disappointing. If you no longer offer the floral calculator then change the picture! And according to the previous reviews i'm not the first person this has happened too so be aware! If the calculator looked the same as the photo then i might haven given it more stars.NB: Since writing my first review i would like to add that i was contacted by the seller who assured me that they are going change the photo as they no longer make the floral pink design's. I was sent a check for a 50% refund for the trouble. I have been using the calculator at school over the past 2 weeks and i actually think it's a great calculator. It does lots of cool functions to make Algebra easier to manage and i have lots of jealous girls in my class that love pink color.

This calculator feels cheaply made, the buttons do not register your pushing on them half the time, it randomly turns off and back on. This thing was such a detriment to my schooling. Due to the many missed punch inputs, my math exams sucked. I had to eventually just forget about trying to use this piece of junk... I had to use my phone.

It fits right in my bag without taking up any space.The second functions are so much better laid out than others I've seen.The amount of functions this small calculator can do is pretty impressive. Makes hypothesis testing much easier!Cons:The buttons are a bit weird to get used to. Sometimes it feels like you push them and other times it doesn't. Strange.The cover is incredibly difficult to get on and off.It has a limitation for the amount of numbers you can input at a time.The screen shows latest calculations; I miss the the graphic calculator that shows me everything I've done.Overall, this was great for the price, and I would purchase another one!","May 9, 2016",the United States

I wish I had gone to a bricks and mortar store and tried it against some other ones, though.  It has all the functions I want, including storing the previous answer, but the buttons don't always register a key press.

I got this calculator because it is the only allowed calculator for tests in my engineering classes, if not, I would have sticked with my casio fx-300 ms.This calculator gets the job done, don't get me wrong, but it has some problems that always bug me. Fist of all the ANS key and the EXP key are soft keys (you have to press 2nd to access them), that is a huge problem for me. Those are the two keys that I use most after the numbers and the operation keys, it sucks that I have to click the 2nd key to access them. The next big problem is that the keys are don't click very well, you have to press them and then make sure that they actually pressed, I constantly get wrong answers because my some of my key-presses don't get entered into the computation.The pros of this calculator are that it is lightweight and small and the display is very nice. Answers and computations are clearly displayed in an easy to read manner.To conlcude, if you have to get this calculator, it is not the worst thing in the world, but if you have a chance, definitely go for a different one.

Everything it does well is faster and easier with a graphing calculator (I've regularly used a TI-82 and a TI-84 Plus).I've had to buy 2 of these because the first one I bought broke after about three months.

I already had the TI-30X which I bought at Walmart.  The TI-30Xa is a superb calculator and does polar/rect &amp; rect/polar conversions as easy as the HP 45 and the HP 11C.  The TI-30X is in the class with the HP45 &amp; HP11C and at $12 at Walmart it can't be beat.I bout the TI-30X IIS thinking it would be an improvement over the TI-30X.  But instead the TI-30X IIS is cumbersome and clunky to use.  To do polar/rectangular rectangular/Polar conversions requires many more key strokes.  In addition the coloring of the second fuctions is in color blue and is very difficult to see.  The second functions on the TI-30Xa is a light green that stands out and is very easy to use.Also, the TI-30X IIS instructions are pitifull, a single large page which is almost unreadable.  The TI-30Xa at least has a booklet with pretty decent set of instructions.In my opinion you should not waste your money  on the TI-30X IIS even though it isn't that expensive.

Secondly the cover for the calculator is annoyingly sticky, it is hard to slide on or off the cover because it gets stuck easily. Thirdly, the buttons on the calculator are  tough to press- as I was calculating, I had to press down hard on a few numbers and twice to have that numerical show up on the screen.

I got the TI-30X IIS by mistake, thinking it was a newer version or something, but it's not.The TI-30X IIS is ok as far as calculators go, but I can't think of any good reason to get this one when the newer TI-30XS Multiview is the same price and is all around a better calculator.If you read through these reviews, you will find many people commenting about how unresponsive the TI-30XS IIS is. As you input your calculation, it will often miss numbers or symbols and you'll have to correct. For whatever reason, this calculator is very slow. If you rapidly tap 232323232323, it will only register about 1/10th of your key presses. If you are very slow about inputting your calculations, this will never be a problem. But it's annoying how often this calculator misses your input.I don't like the way this calculator handles fractions. Rather than displaying them like you would see in a textbook, they show like 9u7/8. Which means 9 and 7/8ths. It's ok, but the TI-30XS Multiview shows fractions in a far more intuitive way.Bottom line, this calculator is obsolete and has been superseded by the TI-30XS Multiview. (Or for a few dollars more, get the TI-36X Pro.)","June 15, 2014",the United States

Second, if you type in numbers too fast the unit will not be able to keep up, and it will omit critical numbers in your calculation. For example, if you type 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9 quickly, the screen may show 1-2-3-5-7-9 as the user input. Obviously this can be of critical importance if you're doing an important calculation.

3672,1.0,"NOT SCIENTIFIC, it is an ALGEBRAIC calculator","Heads up to persons who know math. This is NOT a scientific calculator, it is one of those dumbed-down algebraic calculators.  It is deceptive for it to say ""TI-30"" and ""scientific"" - I thought it would be close to a direct replacement to the old tried and true.  Nope.  So if you are doing math, like opposite/hypotenuse ratio = .34, and then want to take the sine of that, you will have to re-enter as sine .34 not just sin of the ratio already calculated. (If you know their system and enter sin (opposite/hypotenuse) you are OK, but that means you never learned the correct math orders.) Beyond annoying. Good for high schoolers who will never go on to advanced math.  And supposedly this is  not returnable.  If it were not advertised as a TI 30 I would just say ""my bad, whatever, $11 bucks"" but I was really trying for a direct replacement of the aging TI 30 true scientific calculator.

They should have kept the old and added new as required.  I get so sick of electronics folks moving all the furniture, just so they can feel clever.  It is disruptive and time consuming to constantly have to figure out stupid process issues about where keys are newly located instead of just being able to use all the familiar keys and learn the new ones or new extra functions.
